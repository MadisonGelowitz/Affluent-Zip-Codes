# Affluent-Zip-Codes
A webpage that finds Zip Codes based on a User's input and displays them in a Data Table and on a Google Map.

This project requires a proprietary input CSV (not contained in this repo) that contains all possible US Zip Codes and their average incomes. 

This project also uses some proprietary URL magic (that was redacted) to obtain a list of Zip Codes within a certain area based on a User's input.

Built using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery with thanks to:
